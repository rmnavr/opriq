<figcaption>2 main layers of OPRIQ layout</figcaption>

OPRIQ is keyboard layout with following capabilities:
* **FULL left-handed typing support** (meaning any combinations of keys are possible to press with one hand, including: numbers, arrows, F1..F12, plus any combination of Alt/Ctrl/Shift)
* **Two-handed typing as usual** (meaning left-handed typing does not criple two-handed typing in any way)
* **Does not require any additional non-standard hardware** (just a normal ANSI/ISO-keyboard is needed)

Requirements:
* Standard ANSI/ISO-keyboard 
* Ideally keyboard that has 6NKRO support (Anti-ghosting)
  > without it some tricky key combinations (like Alt+Shift+Space+Q) might not work depending on keyboard,
  > still 95% of key combination will work, and remaining 5% will still be pressable with two hands
* OPRIQ works on [AutoHotKey v2.0](https://www.autohotkey.com/), so only Windows is supported (for now?)
